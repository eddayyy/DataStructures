// File Purpose: To document my process of working through this assignment and program
//
// Thoughts: This assignment was very long for me as I had to refresh my memory quite a few times. 
// My process throughout this entire program was to create the class GrocerItems first and then implement 
// the class functions into the main.cpp main function. 
//
// I did this because I wasn't exactly sure how or where to begin and I can confidently say that doing it 
// in this order was a good idea. I was able to understand the functions, their purposes, and their "why". 
// This in turn made the developing process of the main function a whole lot easier. 
// 
// Hands down the hardest part of this assignment was the spaceship operator, the >> operator, and the << operator
// I had to refer to the solution video so that I could thoroughly understand these portions.
//
// The main was a bit hard but overall, I got through it and I'm glad I did.
//
//
// Author's note:
//      I know the //'s are totally unneccessary but they're aesthetically pleasing to me so I will
//   use them throughout this file.
